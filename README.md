To build
--------

To build the mobl compiler you will need a recent version of Eclipse
(3.5+) and [Spoofax](http://www.spoofax.org). When those are
installed, simply clone the mobl repository and import it into
Eclipse, then build the project (Ctrl+Alt+b or Ctrl+Cmd+b).

To clone the repository:

    git clone git://github.com/mobl/mobl.git
    cd mobl
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To use plug-in
--------------
You can easily install the plug-in from the
`http://mobl-lang.org/update` update site. But to keep up-to-date with
the latest developments you will have to build it yourself.

For the latest unstable version, use: `http://hydra.nixos.org/build/769041/download/1/site/` as update site.
